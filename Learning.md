# Understanding the MCP Dummy Example: A Beginner's Guide

This document explains the concept and flow of the `mcp_dummy` FastMCP example in a way that's easy for beginners to understand, using sequential thinking.

## 1. What is MCP and FastMCP?
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a way for AI models and tools to communicate with each other. FastMCP is a Python library that makes it easy to create servers and clients that use this protocol.

## 2. Purpose of the Dummy Example
This dummy project is a minimal, easy-to-understand example. Its goal is to help you learn the basics of FastMCP without any complicated code.

## 3. How the Server Works
The server is a Python script. It uses FastMCP to create a tool called `add`, which takes two numbers and returns their sum. The server waits for requests from clients and responds with the result.

## 4. How the Client Works
The client is another Python script. It connects to the server, asks it to run the `add` tool with two numbers (2 and 3), and prints the result. This shows how a client can use the server's tools remotely, just like calling a function.

## 5. The Flow of Communication
- The server starts and waits for requests.
- The client sends a request to use the `add` tool.
- The server receives the request, runs the tool, and sends back the answer.
- The client prints the answer.

This demonstrates the basic client-server interaction using FastMCP.

## 6. Why This is Useful for Beginners
This example shows the simplest way to create and use an MCP server and client. By focusing on just one tool (`add`), it helps you see the core pattern: define a tool, run the server, connect with a client, and call the tool. Once you understand this, you can add more tools or make the server more complex.

**In summary:**
This dummy project is like a "hello world" for FastMCP. It teaches you the basic building blocks—server, tool, client, and communication—so you can confidently build more advanced MCP applications later.
